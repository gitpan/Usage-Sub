NAME
    Usage::Sub - Issueing subroutine/method usage

SYNOPSIS
      use Usage::Sub;

      sub turn_on {
          @_ >= 2 or usage 'NAME, COLOR [, INTENTSITY]';
          # process goes on
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Usage::Sub provides functions to issueing the usage of subroutines or
    methods from inside the stub. Some people like to check the parameters
    of the routine. For example,

      # turn_on(NAME, COLOR [, INTENSITY])
      sub turn_on {
          @_ >= 2 or die "usage: turn_on(NAME, COLOR [, INTENSITY])\n";
          # the process goes on
      }

    With usage() function (exported by default), you can achieve the same
    result (and more) without having to remember the subroutine name.

      use Usage::Sub;

      sub turn_on {
          @_ >= 2 or usage 'NAME, COLOR [, INTENTSITY]';
          # process goes on
      }

    The usage() function makes use of the caller() built-in function to
    determine the subroutine name. When turn_on() is called with
    inappropriate parameters, usage() will terminate the program with
    backtrace information and prints error message like,

          usage: turn_on(NAME, COLOR [, INTENTSITY])

    If turn_on() is a method, a prefix can be added to indicate it as object
    method or class method call.

      sub turn_on {
          @_ >= 3 or usage 'NAME, COLOR [, INTENTSITY]', '$light';
          # process goes on
      }

    The error message will be then,

          usage: $light->turn_on(NAME, COLOR [, INTENTSITY])

    or

          usage: Light::My::Fire->turn_on(NAME, COLOR [, INTENTSITY])

    should it be a class method call.

    The warn_hard() and warn_soft() functions are similiar to usage(), but
    they don't die. Instead, as the their names suggest, they only warn the
    message out and returning undef. This can be handy for the subroutine to
    print the error message and return immediately in one step.

      sub turn_off {
          @_ >= 2 or return warn_hard('NAME', '$light');
          # process goes on
      }

    The difference between the two is that warn_soft() only works when $^W
    holds true, while warn_hard() always works regardless of the value of
    $^W.
